# Prework Study Guide

## Description

In order to orient myself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before bootcamp started, I needed to create my own study guide using the languages I will be working with in class. By actively creating a project, I reinforced key concepts about these languages and learned how to draft and save through vs code, command line, and git.
